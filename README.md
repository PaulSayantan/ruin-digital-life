# What it does ?
The project is a silly hack to ruin someone 's digital life by targeting both one's computer and social media : 
We have created a website that says that __we can build cool CLI tools__ and the real fun begins when the user register on the website entering his Twitter Id and downloads script to run in his command line terminal.

The registered user will be daily bombarded with dank / demotivational messages on his twitter account by our built twitter bot.
And once he runs our script in his terminal which promises to make his life cool ;) , his all unix commands will not be doing what they are meant for. Think about the fun when he tries to change into other directory but instead a new file is created or maybe getting his system gets shutdown. And another fun thing to happen is that we have included cron job in our script that will again changes wallpaper screen of user's pc to demotivational/dank memes posters
